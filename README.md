# Development Process
    I used an agile method called "	extreme programming for one" and broke game features into stories and tasks.
    I designed an Uml chart to help me visualize the game structure it can be found in Assets/UmlChart.png.

    You can reset your options settings and find more about this project.

# Not Finished Features
    It was planned to add extra feature like extra levels and power ups, unfortunately I didn't have time but my code is very flexible and they could be implemented very easily.

# Problems
    Memory info doesn't display on html5 because in javascript you can't get memory info, to check for memory use the flash version.

# Notes
    Attention to the fact html5 must be running on a web server due to cross origin request problems.
    The both versions of the game(html5 and flash) can be found in the Export folder.
